## How SSH works

Resume of messages:

In the resume you can see that Diffie Hellman process is slightly different to traditional Diffie Hellman change of messages. 

In a standard Diffie Hellman the steps are:

1. Both part accord `p` and `g` parameter
2. Client choose `a` parameter and send A = g^a mod p to the server
3. Server choose `b` parameter and send B = g^b mod p to the client
4. Client calculate the shared secret => s = B^a mod p
5. Server calculate the shared secret with => s = A^b mod p
6. Secret can be calculate with gab mod p = gba mod p

Note that s = g^(a*b) mod p = g^(b*a) mod p

But this process in SSH is bit different. The client send `p` and `g` and use a public key of both parts like `A` and `B` values. He changes the information and calculate the shared secret (use SSH Key previously calculated).

The concept is the same.

1) Client first message

2) Server first message

3) Client send `CLIENT_KEY_EXCHANGE` (Public key in the client)

4) Server send `SERVER_KEY_EXCHANGE` (Public key in the server)

5) Client send to server the `Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange` (p and g values)

6) Server receive the values of the `Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange` and calculate the shared secret

7) Client calculate shared secret too
