### POP3

The most commonly used commands in a POP3 connection are the following:

> **USER <username>**
> **PASS <password>**
> Command to make login with username and password. The server will answer if the login is correct or not.
>
> **STAT**
> STAT simply responds with a single line consisting of two numbers: the number of messages in the box and the total size of those messages in bytes. It's useful for human beings, but less so for automatic clients, which are likely to jump straight to the LIST command.
>
> **LIST**
> LIST lists the contents of the mailbox, naturally enough. It does so by using the standard POP3 multi-line response format. Here's an example:
>   LIST
>   +OK Mailbox contents follow
>   1 7774
>   2 513
>   3 10493
>   .
> The terminating line is a period on a line by itself, which is pretty standard for mail protocols in general. Each line consists of the mail message number (if you delete one, it won't appear in the list, so don't fall into the trap that the numbers are sequential and can thus be ignored!) followed by the size of the message in bytes.
> LIST plus a message number will simply act like STAT for that message.
>
> **RETR msg**
> RETR retrieves a message. Use the message number from LIST. Note that you'll receive the true text of the message, headers followed by a blank line followed by the body, followed by a period on a line by itself. If the body actually contains a period on a line by itself, the mail server will already have doubled that period. So your client needs to undouble it.
>
> **DELE msg**
> DELE deletes a message. It won't actually be deleted until you QUIT the session, and you can undelete everything you've deleted (in case of a mistake) by using RSET.
>
> **RSET**
> You can reset the session to its initial state using the RSET command. This will undelete all messages deleted using DELE.
>
> **TOP msg n**
> TOP is actually an optional command, but most servers support it now. It returns the headers of message msg plus n lines of the body. If n is zero, of course, you just get the headers, which is nice for doing filtering without having to get the entire message.
>
> **QUIT**
> QUIT terminates the session and deletes any messages marked with DELE.
