## Your Mail in the server

You will set up two typical services for the mail:

* **SMTP** is the protocol that lets you to send emails.
* **POP3** is one of the possible protrocols to receive mails that we are going to use. The other common protocol is **IMAP**.

The differences between POP3 and IMAP are small but importants:

```bash
dc_eximconfig_configtype='internet'
dc_other_hostnames='$DNS_NAME'
dc_local_interfaces=''
dc_readhost=''
dc_relay_domains='$RELAY_DOMAINS'
dc_minimaldns='false'
dc_relay_nets='$LOCAL_NETWORK'
dc_smarthost=''
CFILEMODE='644'
dc_use_split_config='false'
