# Your HTTP in the server

We use **apache** and **php**.

apache is used to service files and can be resolve in the client. Also, we can configure it to mount differents domains separated but under the same machine.

For do it, first need define **virtual hosts**. In the example we use 3 virtual hosts:

* virtual host to www1.st.um and basic website.
* virtual host to www2.st.um and basic apache authentication.
* virtual host to www3.st.um to get a secure HTTP based on SSL certificate (HTTPS).

This files are defined in `Services/example/` and with the script we go to copy differents files to differents folders:

* We copy the files of the virtual hosts `Services/example/vhost` to `/etc/apache2/sites-available`
* We copy the files of the websites `Services/example/sites` to `/var/www/`
* We copy the files of the apache authentication methd  `Services/example/groups` to `/etc/apache2/groups`
