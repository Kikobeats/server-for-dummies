## Your HTTP in the server

We use **apache** and **php** for render dynamic code.

Also, we can configure it to mount different domains separated but under the same machine.

For do it, first need define **virtual hosts**. In the example we use 3 virtual hosts:

* virtual host to www1.st.um and basic website.
* virtual host to www2.st.um and basic apache authentication.
* virtual host to www3.st.um to get a secure HTTP based on SSL certificate (HTTPS).

This files are defined in `Services/example/` and with the script we go to copy differents files to differents folders:

* We copy the files of the virtual hosts `Services/example/vhost` to `/etc/apache2/sites-available`.
* We copy the files of the websites `Services/example/sites` to `/var/www/`.
* We copy the files of the apache authentication methd  `Services/example/groups` to `/etc/apache2/groups`.

The SSL Certificate is a case of study that you will see in SSL Chapter.
