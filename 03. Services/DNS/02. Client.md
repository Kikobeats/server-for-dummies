# Your DNS in the client

You need to say at your client that use your DNS to resolve names. Run the script and select this options:

```
1. Install Services > client > DNS
```

Now, you have said in your client that use the IP of your server to resolve names. This is in the file `/etc/resolv.conf`:

```
echo " * Configuring DNS client..."
echo "# Dynamic resolv.conf(5) file for glibc resolver(3) generated by resolvconf(8)
# DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE BY HAND -- YOUR CHANGES WILL BE OVERWRITTEN
nameserver $PRIMARY_DNS
nameserver $SECONDARY_DNS
#search localdomain
" > /etc/resolv.conf
```

In my case have two servers for primary and secondary DNS.
