# LDAP

Maybe at this moment you don't know what is a LDAP but maybe you're using LDAP in the real life.

LDAP *(Lightweight Directory Protocol)* concept is similar to use an address book to annotate information about people around you: Adress, email, work, mobile number...

As the Internet, LDAP is your address book. And you can use LDAP for this. Your address book online!

LDAP is like a database, but it's specially designed for queries and for giving public information about employees of an organization or similar. The tree structure of a LDAP is known as **Directory Information Tree** (*DIT*):

LDAP objects are referenced by its **Distinguished Name** (*DN*). A DN is a sequence of **Relative Distinguished Names** (*RDN*) connected by commas.

An RDN is an attribute with an associated value in the form attribute=value; usually expressed in a UTF-8 string format.

Each entry is a **ObjectClass** that can contain a define type of attributes.

## LDAP Structure

LDAP is structured in entries. The first entry of a LDAP is simulated.

Typically LDAP have a tree distribution, but not always because there can be entries which be *alias* of another entry.

The entry of a LDAP is limited:

* **STRUCTURAL**: Is the ObjectClass that define the entry
* **AUXILIARY**: When the Objectclass is a parent of another ObjectClass. The *root ObjectClass* is `top`
* **ABSTRACT**: Optional ObjectClass that the entry can be container.
