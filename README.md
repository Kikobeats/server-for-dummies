## What is Server Sandbox

`server sandbox` is an educational project created to understand how typical web services works. It's focused on the application layout services.

This documentation is complemented with a script which could be used to install and test all services explained in this book.

You can find it in:

* [Server Sandbox complementary Script on Github.](https://github.com/Kikobeats/server-sandbox)
* [Server Sandbox Documentation on Github.](https://github.com/Kikobeats/server-sandbox/tree/docs)

Note that this is only an educational example and don't recommended use it in production.

* IPSec

Feel free to [tell us](https://github.com/Kikobeats/server-sandbox/issues) what protocols do you like to see explained.

## What you need before read Server Sandbox

Take this book as a practical example of how to put the theory into reality. We try to explain basic concepts about each protocol but is impossible write a little book explaining all details.

We recommended you read the book [Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach by James F. Kurose](http://www.amazon.com/James-F.-Kurose/e/B001IGQHKM) if you need more information about how to protocol works and many times [Wikipedia the free encyclopedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) can explained the protocols with more correctness.
