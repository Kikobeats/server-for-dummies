`server sandbox` is an educational project created to understand how typical web services work. It's focused on the application layout services.

This documentation is complemented with a script which could be used to install and test all services explained in this book. You can find it in [Server Sandbox Github repository](https://kikobeats.github.io/server-sandbox).

**NOTE:** This is only an educational example. Don't use it in production.
