# 7. SMTP/POP

Mail is the basic, oldest and most popular service of the internet.

For support mail, you need support DNS before. This is because mail is based on mailbox concept: All mail accounts need a mailbox for send (SMTP) and receive (POP3/IMAP).

When you want to send a mail, you going to deposit the mail in the receive mailbox of the receiver, but have a little problem: don't know the adress of the destination mailbox.

For know it, you need to use DNS query of the server name of the mailbox adress, and he say you the direction where you cand send the mail. And also the process is similar when you want to check your mail account. You can see this more later when We analyze the traffic with wireshark.

## 7.2 Mount your Mail

### 7.2.1 Your Mail in the server

we will set up two typical services for mail:

* **SMTP** is the protocol to can send emails.
* **POP3** is one of the posibles protrocols to receive mails that we are to use. The other common protocol is **IMAP**.


The differences between POP3 and IMAP are littles but importants:

### 7.2.3 Configuring POP3

![image](img/pop.png)

1. Install the service **dovecot** for use POP3 in your server.
2. Configure defaults options in `/etc/dovecot/conf.d/10-auth.conf` and `/etc/dovecot/conf.d/10-mail.conf`.

### 7.2.2 Configuring SMTP

![image](img/smtp.png)

1. Install the service **exim4**
2. Configure standards options in `/etc/exim4/update-exim4.conf.conf` about your DNS:

```
dc_eximconfig_configtype='internet'
dc_other_hostnames='$DNS_NAME'
dc_local_interfaces=''
dc_readhost=''
dc_relay_domains='$RELAY_DOMAINS'
dc_minimaldns='false'
dc_relay_nets='$LOCAL_NETWORK'
dc_smarthost=''
CFILEMODE='644'
dc_use_split_config='false'
dc_hide_mailname=''
dc_mailname_in_oh='true'
dc_localdelivery='maildir_home'
```

## 7.3 Check connectivity

For the test first we ping the DNS service and later do a telnet in the port of the service.

### 7.4.1 POP3

The most commonly used commands in a POP3 connection are as follows:

> **USER <username>**
> **PASS <password>**
> Command to make login with a username and password. The server response if the login is correct or not.
> 
> **STAT**
> STAT simply responds with a single line consisting of two numbers: the number of messages in the box and the total size of those messages in bytes. It's useful for human beings, but less so for automatic clients, which are likely to jump straight to the LIST command.
> 
> **LIST**
> LIST lists the contents of the mailbox, naturally enough. It does so by using the standard POP3 multi-line response format. Here's an example:
>   LIST
>   +OK Mailbox contents follow
>   1 7774
>   2 513
>   3 10493
>   .
> The terminating line is a period on a line by itself, which is pretty standard for mail protocols in general. Each line consists of the mail message number (if you delete one, it won't appear in the list, so don't fall into the trap that the numbers are sequential and can thus be ignored!) followed by the size of the message in bytes.
> LIST plus a message number will simply act like STAT for that message.
> 
> **RETR msg**
> RETR retrieves a message. Use the message number from LIST. Note that you'll receive the true text of the message, headers followed by a blank line followed by the body, followed by a period on a line by itself. If the body actually contains a period on a line by itself, the mail server will already have doubled that period. So your client needs to undouble it.
> 
> **DELE msg**
> DELE deletes a message. It won't actually be deleted until you QUIT the session, and you can undelete everything you've deleted (in case of a mistake) by using RSET.
> 
> **RSET**
> You can reset the session to its initial state using the RSET command. This will undelete all messages deleted using DELE.
> 
> **TOP msg n**
> TOP is actually an optional command, but most servers support it now. It returns the headers of message msg plus n lines of the body. If n is zero, of course, you just get the headers, which is nice for doing filtering without having to get the entire message.
> 
> **QUIT**
> QUIT terminates the session and deletes any messages marked with DELE.
