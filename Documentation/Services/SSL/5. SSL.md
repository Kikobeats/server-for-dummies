# 5. SSL

SSL (*Secure Sockets Layer*) is the standard security technology for establishing an encrypted link between a web server and a browser. This link ensures that all data passed between the web server and browsers remain private and integral. SSL is an industry standard and is used by millions of websites in the protection of their online transactions with their customers.

SSL does two things:

1. **Authenticates the server to the client.** (*Handshake*)
2. Encrypts your HTTP session.

We go to explain **Handshake** process.

Is the first step to get secure connection. This process is know as **Handshake**:

* Client send `clientHello` message specifying encrypted options: SSL version, compress method,... and sending random numbers that they use later.
* The server receive the message and select:
	* What simetric algorythm (**secret key**) use (e.g. [AES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard), [3DES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_DES), [RC5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RC5)).
	* What asimetric algorythm (**public key**) use (e.g. [RSA](wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem), [Diffie-Hellman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange)).
	* What MAC algorythm use.

	And send to the client `serverHello` with this options, distinctive server number and their certificates to check the 	identify of the server domain.

* The client verify the server certificate, get **public key** and generate **pre-master secret** (PMS). Encrypted PMS with **public key** of the server and send it.

* The client receive the data and both calculate **Master secret** with PMS and distinctive numbers.


The MAC algorythm is use to verify that data of the session is authenticathed.

The complexities of the SSL protocol remain invisible to your customers. Instead their browsers provide them with a key indicator to let them know they are currently protected by an SSL encrypted session - the lock icon in the lower right-hand corner, clicking on the lock icon displays your SSL Certificate and the details about it. All SSL Certificates are issued to either companies or legally accountable individuals.

## 5.1 Information

| Description  | Service
| -------------	|:-------------
| Aplication	|	SSL 			
| Transport		|	TCP			
| Network		|   IPv4/IPv6	
| Ports			|	80 (with HTTP)

## 5.2 Mount your SSL
### 5.2.1 SSL in the client
### 5.2.2 SSL in the server

Typically an SSL Certificate will contain your domain name, your company name, your address, your city, your state and your country. It will also contain the expiration date of the Certificate and details of the Certification Authority responsible for the issuance of the Certificate. When a browser connects to a secure site it will retrieve the site's SSL Certificate and check that it has not expired, it has been issued by a Certification Authority the browser trusts, and that it is being us
