# 2. Understand how Internet Works

Internet is the best invent in the last 50 years, and maybe someone can say that is the best invent in the world.

First, relax. Internet is not perfect and need much value human to make it normally secure service for cotidians things, for example, read your mail, visit a website of cats, download creative commons music and films...

Internet is nested in layers called [OSI model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model). 7 layers compound the OSI model and each layer offer services for differents things.

Up layers need inferior layer to offer a services. Your browser don't load a website if transport protocol don't work correctly.

Other importans networks elements are routers, switch and host and use different protocols (BGP, RIP, OSPF) to communicate with each and make internet: a network of computers that understand how to travel a packet from EEUU to Spain.

But this is not important here. You need to understand how to ready your machine to be accesible for the rest of people and can be offer your services for resolve names, have mails accounts under your domain,....

The services that you intend to use belong to the application layer. As I said before, this services use services or protocols of inferior layers of the OSI model. For example, DNS is a aplication services, but need a transport protocol to be resolve name to IP, and by other hand, IP is based on network layer IPv4 (or better, IPv6) to be operative for application layer.

In the end, all is a stack of abstraction to be application layer available, secure and operative for the principle internet proposite.

Now, is the moment of the action!
