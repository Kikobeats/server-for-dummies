## Sample data

For testing services we added a sample data for the following services:

### HTTP

Dividided in three domains:
* `www1.st.um` – Basic domain
* `www2.st.um` – Domain with HTTP authentication ([authorized users here](https://github.com/Kikobeats/server-sandbox/blob/master/Services/HTTP/example/groups))
* `www3.st.um` – Domain with HTTPS (check you are visiting https in the browser! automatic redirect isn't activated).
